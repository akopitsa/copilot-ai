| app.yaml          | I would like to have kubernetes yaml that's why I am asking you to Create a simple application with a kind=pod and image=gcr.io/stable-vista-418814/mock_webserver:2.0.0 and label it app=demo and expose port 8080 and name the port HTTP | Create simple yaml file for pod with specific configurations and label it, exposing port 8080. | [app.yaml](yaml/app.yaml)         |
| app-livenessProbe.yaml | Generate kubernetes yaml file that contain a liveness probe on the port 8080, with initialDelaySeconds set to 10s, timeoutSeconds set to 5s, periodSeconds set to 10s, and failureThreshold set to 2s        | Ensure the pod's liveness by configuring a probe with specified parameters. | [app-livenessProbe.yaml](yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml) |
| app-readinessProbe.yaml | Generate kubernetes yaml file that contain a readiness probe, with initialDelaySeconds set to 1s, timeoutSeconds set to 5s, and failureThreshold set to 3s. | Ensure the pod's liveness by configuring a probe with specified parameters. | [app-readinessProbe.yaml](yaml/app-readinessProbe.yaml) |
| app-volumeMounts.yaml | Generate kubernetes yaml file that contains a volume with name "data" and hostPath /var/lib/app, and mount it at path "/data". | Configure a volume and mount it to the pod at a specific path. | [app-volumeMounts.yaml](yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml)         |
| app-cronjob.yaml  | Generate kubernetes yaml file that contains a cronjob named "cronjob", scheduled to run every 15 minutes using image bash, with the command ["echo", "Hello kubernetes"], and restart policy set to failure           | Schedule a recurring task within the cluster, executing specified commands. | [app-cronjob.yaml](yaml/app-cronjob.yaml)         |
| app-job.yaml      | Generate kubernetes yaml file that contains kubernetes job utilizing gcePersistentDisk named data-input, with pdName glow-data-disk-200, fsType set to ext4, and a container using google sdk latest alpine.
